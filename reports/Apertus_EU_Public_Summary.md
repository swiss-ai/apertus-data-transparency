Latest date of data acquisition/collection for model training:

Description of the linguistic characteristics of the overall training data:

Main  pretraining  dataset  knowledge  cutoff  is  03/2024,  while  some domain-specific parts of the dataset (math) and parts of the post-training datasets have a later date of collection.

The pretraining dataset includes more than 1000 languages (1782 language-script pairs), as provided by the FineWeb-2 and FineWeb-2HQ datasets respectively. The amount of data per language reflects the natural frequency of web data in each language, thus improving Other relevant characteristics of the overall training data:

Additional comments (optional):

2. List of data sources representation of many communities with languages not present in most leading LLMs yet.

Data has been rigorously filtered for respecting consent by website owners (opt-out  for  AI  crawlers,  also  retroactively),  remove  PII  (e-mail,  IP addresses, IBAN), remove toxic content, and avoid verbatim memorization during model training.

The Apertus tokenizer builds upon the Mistral v3 (tekken), and is used for data size statistics (see also the Apertus technical report).

List of large publicly available datasets:

The following large pretraining datasets derived from CommonCrawl were used, with data from 2013 onward to a knowledge cutoff of March 2024 (CC-MAIN-2024-10). The datasets were not used as is but additionally filtered for opt-out retrospectively, for toxicity, high quality, and other preprocessing as detailed below.

In addition, the pretraining data contained small amounts of canary/poisoning data were added by https://spylab.ai/, as well as memorization detection traces from public domain project Gutenberg books.

Additional comments (optional):

The full training data (for pre- and post-training) is publicly available and reproducible with our provided data filtering scripts, provided here:

## 2.2 Private non-publicly available datasets obtained from third parties

Additional comments (optional):

## 3.2 Removal of illegal content

General description of measures taken:

- [ ] ☐ Yes

- [x] ☒ No

In curating the training data, standard machine-readable opt-out by all websites were respected. In addition, data from websites which had recently opted out by specifying at least one of the common AI crawlers, at the time of January 2025 were removed. Crucially, such removals were also applied retroactively in all earlier crawls since 2013, of each corresponding website present in our datasets. Pretraining and posttraining datasets were additionally filtered for licence compliance, and processed by PII (e-mail, IP addresses, and IBAN) removal.

Please refer to Chapter B of the Code of Practice for the Apertus LLM:

[huggingface.co/swiss-ai/Apertus70B-2509](https://huggingface.co/swiss-ai/Apertus-70B-2509/blob/main/Apertus_EU_Code_of_Practice.pdf)
Before training, toxic documents from the pretraining corpora were removed by employing a deep learning classifer trained on top of XLM-Roberta multilingual embeddings. The classifiers were trained using the multilingual datasets provided by https://github.com/Pleias/toxic-commons . In addition to toxicity filtering, most datasets also were filtered by additional quality classifiers, which are made transparently available, and which further help to reduce problematic content.

## 3.3. Other information (optional)

Other relevant information about data processing (optional):

In addition to the full transparency of ensuring all training data of our models is openly available and reproducible (the Apertus models being open-data and open-weights), techniques to minimize  memorization  or  potentially  remaining  copyrighted content  were  employed:  During  training,  the [Goldfish  loss technique](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.10209),  which  disables verbatim memorization of text sequences longer than 50 tokens. More precisely, every 50th token (on average) of our pretraining data is not provided a prediction target, i.e. has no loss function, and thus breaks any verbatim memorization beyond that sequence length.  More  detailed  results  on  the  success  of  this  mitigation technique can be found in the model's technical report.
